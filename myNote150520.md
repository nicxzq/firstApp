# daily note

today, i got a new task. To develop a new function. but i m not familiar with the whole platform, so this task is a lit bit hard to me. however, i have the confidence to work it out.
first, i should know the requirement; then analysis the demand to design how to do it, only by this way i can begin coding. up to now, i have some ideas but need to verify them; last, i have only a few time, so i will do as fast as i can.
as usual, i read the book 'carl weter's educational law', in this book, he said that father should train their child's courage, concentration, independent, endurance, fight for good and give up for bad. a man's good habit need to train from childhood.
its getting late, lets go to bed.
